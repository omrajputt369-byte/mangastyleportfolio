Welcome to the **OM CODES** repository! This is a cutting-edge portfolio experience crafted with a high-fidelity **Japanese Manga & Modern Minimalist** aesthetic. Inspired by the "Manga-BlackRed" art style, it blends traditional comic book screentones with sleek, reactive animations to showcase my journey as a Frontend Developer and UI/UX Designer.
